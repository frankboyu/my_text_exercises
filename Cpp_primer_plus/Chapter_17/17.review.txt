1.  It includes the definitions of the classes and methods of standard C++ I/O capabilities
2.  Because the typed number is in text format, which includes the invidivual characters representing the number, instead of the internal machine coding of the number
3.  Standard output is handled by cout and is buffered, while the standard error is handled by cerr and is not buffered
    (v) standard error is always connected to the monitor while the output can be directed to a file
4.  Because the the insertion operator is overloaded for all the fundamental types in C++
5.  That the method returns a reference of the invoking object itself
6.  int number;
    cout << "Enter an integer";
    cin >> number;
    cout << showbase;
    cout << setw(15) << dec << number << setw(15) << oct << number << setw(15) << hex << number << endl;
7.  string name;
    double wage, hours;
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Enter your hourly wage: ";
    cin >> wage;
    cout << "Enter number of hours worked: ";
    cin >> hours;
    cout << "First format:" << endl;
    cout << right;
    cout << setw(30) << name << ": $" << setw(10) << wage << setw(5) << hours;
    cout << "Second format:" << endl;
    cout << left;
    cout << setw(30) << name << ": $" << setw(10) << wage << setw(5) << hours;
    (v) cout << showpoint << fixed << right;
    setprecision(2) and setprecision(1)
8.  ct1 = 8; ct2 = 9
    (v)5 and 9
9.  ingore() can only discard up to 80 characters, while get() can discard all the way to the newline character
