1.  Stonewt Stonewt::operator*(double factor) const
    {
        return Stonewt(pounds*factor);
    }
2.  Friend function is not invoked by the class object. Any argument has to be passed explicitly as function arguments.
    Member function is invoked by the class object. The invoking object is passed implicitly.
3.  (x)No, if the class has methods to return the class's Member
4.  Stonewt operator*(double factor, const Stonewt & this_stonewt)
    {
        return this_stonewt*factor;
    }
5.  sizeof, ., .*, ::, ?:, typeid, const_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, static_cast.
6.  They can be overloaded only with memeber functions
7.  Vector::operator double() const
    {
